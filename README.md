exemplar college student style notes for an intro-soil class

This was assymbled long ago. Some content was revised every academic semester something was tweaked great or small.

In 2015 a new CSS template from Pixalarity was applied to make it a responsive site. This is still web facing at Enviro-Soil.com but needs a refresh. So, now it is getting a wash and is likely to be retired. 

In May 2022 a latexstyle.css is being applied to the web pages replacing the Pixalarity CSS template (ongoing).
